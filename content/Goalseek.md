“What are you optimising for?” is one of the most important questions to ask whenever you are working on something with multiple constraints, especially when those constraints cannot all be optimized at the same time.

Most conflicts, frustrations, and inner turmoil come from optimising for the wrong thing, or worse, trying to optimise for everything at once.

Goalseeking the right thing. most often, the thing that gives you calm, can be a powerful way to become a gentler person and, perhaps, get closer to that elusive sense of peace.

A few examples: 

**A child throwing a tantrum**

A child is upset, emotions are running high, and we instinctively try to teach a lesson in that moment.

But the child is not in a state to receive one. They are already battling multiple emotions: guilt, fear, confusion, the sense that an authority figure is upset, and maybe even the quiet panic of “Will I ever be loved again?”

At that point in time, the correct goalseek is not teaching, but calming.

There will be time for the lesson later, when the child is calmer, safer, and more receptive. Trying to optimize for both calm and instruction at the same time usually achieves neither.

**Someone who shows up late, but shows up consistently**

Someone arrives late, but they arrive every single day.

Do we optimize for punctuality and spend our energy being upset, chiding them repeatedly, and carrying that frustration forward?

Or do we goalseek for consistency and reliability, accepting that timing is imperfect?

Here too, the question is not about right or wrong, it is about what you are choosing to optimize for, and whether that choice brings peace or constant friction.

**A job that pays slightly less, but gives more time**

I make a little less money, but I gain more time.

If I am goalseeking purely for income, this job is a downgrade. But if I am goalseeking for wealth in the broader sense, it is a clear upgrade.

I am a little less rich, but a lot more wealthy.

The freedom to spend time the way you want - to think, to rest, to be present - is deeply liberating, and often undervalued because it does not show up neatly on a balance sheet.

In many situations, life doesn’t reward optimising for everything. It rewards clarity about what matters most right now.

Choosing the right thing to optimise for, especially choosing calm over control, presence over performance, and sufficiency over excess, quietly changes how we move through the world.

And perhaps, over time, it changes who we become
