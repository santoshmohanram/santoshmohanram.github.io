Every so often, I try to step back and examine the quiet assumptions that shape how I see the world, the internal compass points that help me make sense of randomness, people, choices, and my own reactions to life. Over time, a handful of ideas have stayed with me. They don’t form a philosophy as much as a set of working principles: adjustable, lived-in, and constantly reinterpreted as life unfolds.

These are some of my core tenets.

**1.**     **The World Is More Random Than We Admit**

There is far more luck entwined in our stories than our egos like to accept. We often treat outcomes as the inevitable result of effort, intelligence, or planning, when the truth is that we are floating in a sea of chance. The book Fluke captured this beautifully with a line I often return to:

**“We control nothing, but influence everything.”**

Understanding randomness does not make life bleak, it makes it gentler. When we acknowledge how contingent everything is, we judge less and appreciate more. We also stop taking our own successes so personally, and our failures so fatally. Life becomes less about control and more about navigation.

**2.**     **Science as the Ultimate Filter for Truth**

If randomness teaches humility, science teaches clarity. I have found that treating the scientific method as a sieve, a filter through which information must pass and it saves me from a lot of nonsense. It creates a clean divide between what is merely believed and what is actually supported.

When I guide my thinking through testability, evidence, and falsifiability, the world becomes less confusing. Fake ideas reveal themselves quickly. So do real ones. Science does not have an answer for everything, but it has a reliable way of telling us when something is not true, which is often more important.

We carry in our pockets a device that can speak to satellites, compress the world into glass, and map our position on a spinning planet. We fly across continents in metal tubes powered by physics we barely think about. As I write this, Voyager has drifted a light-day away from Earth, a tiny human artifact sailing into interstellar space.

It is astonishing what science makes possible, and equally astonishing how quickly we forget it… only to turn around and entertain the most inane superstitions!

Science gives us a lighthouse in a stormy sea. It feels wise to look up from time to time and remember where that light comes from.

**3.**     **Give People a Chance (and Then Another One)**

One of my favourite passages in literature comes from **A Gentleman in Moscow**:

**“By their very nature, human beings are so capricious, so complex, so delightfully contradictory, that they deserve not only our consideration, but our reconsideration—and our unwavering determination to withhold our opinion until we have engaged with them in every possible setting at every possible hour.”**

People are inconsistent, contradictory, layered. We are all different depending on the hour, the setting, the emotional weather we are moving through. To form an opinion after a single snapshot is to misunderstand what a human being even is.

This tenet reminds me to suspend judgment, not because I am virtuous, but because I am usually wrong on the first pass.

**4.**     **Everyone Lives in Their Own Umwelt**

An extension of the above point is one of my favourite words – Umwelt. The idea that each organism experiences the world through a private, limited, sensory tunnel. We do not inhabit the same reality, not fully. We inhabit interpretations filtered through biology, memory, culture, temperament, and experience.

Recognizing this removes the expectation that others should react as I do, understand as I do, or feel as I feel. Their world is not my world. And that is precisely what makes people interesting.

**5.**     **Build Slack into Systems**

Perfection is brittle. Efficiency breaks. Life is full of small fluctuations; a maid who does not show up, a driver who is late, a car in front of you that is driving slowly, an unexpected delay, a last-minute plan. If your system and mental models collapses every time something minor slips, it is not a good system.

I have realized over time that resilience matters more than precision. The more slack we build into our routines - mental, emotional, logistical - the less the world can knock us off balance.

A little buffer is often the difference between calm and chaos.

**6.**     **What You’re Thinking About Always Feels More Important Than It Is**

Daniel Kahneman captured this bias perfectly: **“Nothing is as important as it is when you are thinking about it.”**

Our attention creates artificial gravity. Whatever occupies the mind, a worry, an argument, an insecurity, swells to fill the entire frame. Hours or days later, the same issue feels strangely hollow, as if someone deflated it.

This tenet reminds me not to trust the intensity of the present moment too much. The mind is a magnifying glass, not a neutral lens.

**A Continuing Project**

I expect this list to evolve as I do. For now, they form the scaffolding on which I hang most of my reflections.
